# Natural Language Processing: Vector Space Semantics for Similarity between Eastenders Characters

This project improves the representation and distinction of characters from the Eastenders in the vector space. The baseline process implements simple pre-processing, feature extraction and vectorization methods. The aim is to achieve a mean rank of 1, which is interpreted as all the characters being correctly distinguished and identified. The dataset isn't public.
